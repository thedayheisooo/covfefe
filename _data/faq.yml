          We are offering the US #resistance a daily reminder that it’s worth it
          to keep fighting because we are ultimately going to win! The reminder
          comes in form of a label you can put on a drink of your choice.
          Champagne (coming soon), wine (coming soon), beer – however you like
          to celebrate. The best part: By preparing your drink for the big #ooo
          party, you are helping getting the party started! With every label you
          buy, you donate $3 USD to organizations who fight for our democracy.
        q: What is this all about?
      - a: >-
          Not at all! We’re just supporting the other organizations (partner
          organizations will be announced soon) and activists out there. One
          could call us “the movement behind the movement.”
        q: Are you just another organization fighting the insanity?
      - a: >-
          By selling our label -- it really is that simple. Think about it: by
          selling awesome labels we raise money for all the great organizations
          (partner organizations will be announced soon) out there. More
          importantly, we’re reminding the resistance of the light at the end of
          the tunnel -- in dark times we all need something to look forward to!
          And boy, do we have something to look forward to. We’re going to have
          a party so legendary it will go down in history.
        q: How do you support the resistance?
      - a: >-
          This won’t be even necessary. Think about it: when the news breaks
          that he is finally #ooo, what happens next? Our guess: the world will
          stand still for a moment, take a deep breath, and then people will
          fill the streets of NYC, Chicago, Houston and hell, maybe even rural
          Mississippi, ready to celebrate! It will be a glorious day.
        q: So you guys are going to organize a party?
      - a: >-
          An important step towards the end of injustice, lies, racism -- the
          whole enchilada.
        q: What will we actually be celebrating?
      - a: >-
          We feel you. Some members of our team are exactly the same way. (Guess
          who? Yep, the two Germans.) They’ll probably just sit alone on their
          balcony with their drinks, cloudwatch, and shed a tear of relief.
        q: But I am not that into parties.
      - a: >-
          No one needs us, we’re not important! Only you and your resistance are
          important. We’re just here in case you lose your motivation. We want
          to remind you that we are many and we will win!
        q: Why do I need you to celebrate that he is ooo?
      - a: Yes – we love and appreciate your change of heart!
        q: >-
          I voted for him and now I regret it. Am I still allowed to celebrate
          with you?
      - a: >-
          The day he is #ooo is the day to celebrate – nothing more! The very
          next day the fight will be fucking on again and we will be here
          fighting Pence and/or rebuilding our democracy, values, and society.
        q: >-
          Wait, there won’t be anything left to celebrate when he is ooo.
          There’s no way we can recover from the damage he has done to the
          country, and what if we end up with Pence as president?
      - a: >
          Why should we only let Russians meddle with our politics? And hey, the
          Trump crowd hates this movement even more for our international and
          diverse team. Now that we think about it: We should add Mexicans and
          Muslims to our team. Shoot us a message if you belong to a minority
          Trump hates and you have time to support us.
        q: >-
          There are guys from Germany in your team – why don’t they stay out of
          our politics?
      - a: >
          Yes, but as long as he does not change our country into an autocracy
          the second term will be his last term and we’ll get to party
          eventually.
        q: Trump might serve a second term.
      - a: >
          We don’t hate you little Snowflake, we just feel sorry! Well and we
          are wondering, did we get covered by Fox News or how else did you find
          us?
        q: 'I am pro Trump, I am very angry and I hate all of this.'

          if you blew it it means he is gone soon, yay!
