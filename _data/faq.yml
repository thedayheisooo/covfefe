          We are offering the #resistance all over the US a daily reminder that
          it is worth to keep fighting because we are going to win ultimately!
          The reminder comes in form of a label you can put on a drink of your
          choice. Champagne, wine, beer – however you like to celebrate.The
          best: By getting your drink for the big ooo party prepared, you are
          helping getting the party started! With every label you buy you donate
          4 USD to organizations who fight for our democracy.
        q: What is this all about?
      - a: >
          Not at all! We are just supporting the other organizations (link
          “donate” section) and their activists out there. One could call us
          “the movement behind the movement”.
        q: Are you just another organization fighting the insanity?
      - a: >
          By selling our label, it is that simple. Think about it: By selling
          awesome labels (link to shop site) we raise money for all the great
          organizations (link to donate section) out there and more importantly,
          we are reminding the resistance that a great party will come - in dark
          times you need something to look forward to! And boy, we have
          something to look forward to - we are going to have a party so
          legendary it will go down in history.
        q: How do you support the resistance?
      - a: >
          This won’t be even necessary. Think about it, the moment the news
          breaks that he is finally ooo – what happens next? Our guess: The
          world will stand still for a moment, the world will take a deep breath
          and then people will fill the streets of NYC, Chicago, Houston and
          hell, probably even in rural Mississippi! It will be a glorious day.
        q: So you guys are going to organize a party?
      - a: >
          Not the end but an important step towards the end of injustice, lies,
          racism, the whole enchilada.
        q: What will we actually be celebrating?
      - a: >
          Actually, some in our team are just like that (guess who! Exactly, the
          two Germans). They will just sit alone on their balcony with their
          drink, watch the clouds and shed a tear of relief and deep
          contentedness.
        q: I am not the guy for parties.
      - a: >
          No one needs us, we are not important! Only you and your resistance
          are important. We are just here in case you lose your motivation to
          remind you that we are many and that we will win!
        q: Why do I need you to celebrate that he is ooo?
      - a: |
          Yes – we love and appreciate you!
        q: >-
          I voted for him and now I regret it – am I still allowed to celebrate
          with you?
      - a: >
          The day he is ooo is the day to celebrate – nothing else! The very
          next day the fight will be fucking on again and we will be on your
          side fighting Pence and/or rebuild our democracy, values and society.
        q: >-
          Wait, there is nothing left to celebrate when he is ooo. We will not
          recover easily from the damage he has done to the country and maybe
          we’ll have Pence as president?

          Why should we only let Russians meddle with our politics? And hey, the
          Trump crowd hates this movement even more for our international and
          diverse team. Now that we think about it: We should add Mexicans and
          Muslims to our team. Shoot us a message if you belong to a minority
          Trump hates and you have time to support us.
        q: >-
          There are guys from Germany in your team – why don’t they stay out of
          our politics?
      - a: >
          Yes, but as long as he does not change our country into an autocracy
          the second term will be his last term and we’ll get to party
          eventually.
        q: Trump might serve a second term.
      - a: >
          We don’t hate you little Snowflake, we just feel sorry! Well and we
          are wondering, did we get covered by Fox News or how else did you find
          us?
        q: 'I am pro Trump, I am very angry and I hate all of this.'
