title: About. Who we are.
intro: >-
  We thought long about adding this section to our website because we are just a
  pretty random group of people and we don’t want to make any of this about us.
  However, we came to understand that even though we don’t take ourselves very
  seriously many of you care about the team behind the project. You want be
  assured you'll get a good product and that we support organizations you can
  identify with.  


  <br>


  So here is the short story about “The Day He is Out Of Office” – we will try
  not to be sarcastic for once. The project or rather the idea for it began in
  the weeks after the 2016 election. We were deeply troubled by what happened,
  we were scared of Trump’s dangerous agenda and we were mad about the rigged
  system and the worst of it: We felt powerless. But we quickly learned that
  thanks to Trump hundreds of thousands of concerned Americans woke up and came
  together to organize and resist – this gave us hope and made us think about
  ways we can support the resistance. There are already so many great non-profit
  organizations out there that it was clear to us, that the US does not need
  another one. Instead we could raise money for the already existing
  organizations in a smart way – after all product development and creating
  campaigns is part of our daily business anyway.

  And then there was the bottle of Champain Dan bought in 2017. He confidently
  told all of us: “I am promising you: Trump is dumb as a rock, acts against the
  interest of his own base and he is a criminal. There is no way he will still
  be president one year from now and as soon as he is out we will all meet to
  pop open this bottle. And then we will hit the street of NYC to celebrate with
  all the other people. Until then this bottle is my reminder that we will win
  eventually – I call it my ooo bottle.”. Adam joked around about how Dan should
  produce a special drink just for this day, kind of like the iconic cigars they
  had in the movie Independence Day which were only to be smoked after the
  victory over the evil thread to the US and the whole world. And then it
  clicked and the rest will be history ...

  This is a little side project of a diverse team of volunteers. Don't forget:
  This is all about the movement and not about us! However, in case you have
  serious trust issues it might help you to see some of the beutiful faces
  behind the the project.

      Is there something Trump hates more than a strong liberal woman? Yes, if
      she is a journalist on top of it! Just like the rest on the team she knows
      what she will be doing the day he is #ooo … unfortunately she will have to
      work and stay sober to report the latest developments to us. Thanks for
      your service Eli – we will celebrate you and all the fellow journalists on
      the big day :)

      Adam was so mad about Trump that he dumped a side project he was working
      on so he has a couple of hours each weekend to work on thedayheisooo.com.
      He even offered to take the lead with all the legal crap we have to do
      just to sell some stickers – CEO is therefore not a made up startup
      bullshit bingo title, he is the C.E.O. of the TinyHands Ltd.* hell yeah!

      Brian is one of the shy IT guys and the reason everything here looks as
      awesome as it does and runs smoothly. The day he is out of office he will
      have only one beer so he can make sure our servers don't crash! Just
      kidding ... who cares about servers that day?

      In summary Dan already lost 220 bucks betting that Trump will be #ooo by
      certain dates. He says he does not care about it but we are sure: When
      Trump is gone Dan will be mainly celebreating the fact that he won't lose
      any more bets. At least he promised us to stop betting with Republicans
      and focus more on connecting us with all the organizations out there.
