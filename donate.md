title: Where your money should go
intro: >-
  We don’t have to accept what is going on. If you have some cash to spare, even
  a small amount, there are plenty of organizations you can donate money to – we
  list some of them below. By the way: We initially planned to collect money for
  these organizations but this is a bit difficult in some cases (legal stuff).
  So stay tuned until we have figured this out! Once we found a couple of good
  options we will let you vote on how we should use part of the money collected
  by selling our labels. Follow us on Twitter to not miss the voting!

      This organization is urging Congress to pass a resolution calling for the
      House Committee on the Judiciary to investigate whether sufficient grounds
      exist for the impeachment of Donald John Trump, President of the United
      States. In other words: They are helping getting the #ooo-party starting
      as soon as possible.

      Everytown is a movement of Americans working together to end gun violence
      and build safer communities. More than 4 million mayors, moms, cops,
      teachers, survivors, gun owners, and everyday Americans have come together
      to make their own communities safer. Together, they are fighting for the
      changes that will save lives.

      In January 2017 over 3 million people were on the streets all over the US,
      actively protesting pretty much everything Trump stands for and to harness
      the political power of diverse women and their communities to create
      transformative social change. The New York Times reported that
      crowd-scientists estimate that the Women’s March was three times the size
      of the Trump inauguration – we hope the celebrations the day he is ooo
      will be at least almost as big.

      The National Immigrant Justice Center is a dedicated organization that
      ensures the protection of human rights for all immigrants, asylum seekers
      and refugees – so basically everything he hates. Furthermore, the NIJ also
      enables them to have access to direct legal services and advocates as it
      pushes policy reforms and systematic change in the legal system.

      Launched after Donald Trump’s election, Indivisible became a nationwide
      movement of thousands of volunteer-led local groups that engage in
      progressive advocacy and electoral work at the local, state, and national
      level. Indivisible Project was established to lift up that grassroots
      movement of local groups to defeat the Trump agenda, elect progressive
      leaders, and realize bold progressive policies.

      Instead of draining the swamp, he brought the swamp to the white house.
      This happened to a certain extent under democratic presidents as well.
      This is why the justice democrats support Democrats which are representing
      people, not corporations. Because it’s time to take back the party for
      voters, not big money donors.
